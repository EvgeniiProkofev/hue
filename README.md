I wrote this because it is useful to me.  It probably isn't to you, but is it a good example of how to interact with philips hue and lux lighting from the unix command line.

Shell scripts I wrote to contol my Philips Hue, LightStrips, dimmable white, and Lux lighting

The script can be used to control lights by either group name or light number
